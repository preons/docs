The Preons cli along with the preons.yaml allows you to customise your own functional css library. Maybe you prefer a different typescale for your fonts. Your website will need different colors or even additional colours than the one in the default preons theme. Maybe there are additional css properties that your project needs like filter, transitions and css grid.
