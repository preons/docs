## What is Preons

It is two main things:

- A functional css library and theme so you can start building your UIs quickly
- A CLI tool to help build and make it easier to work with your own functional CSS libraries and create unique interfaces over and over again

## What do the classes look like

Each functional css class represents a [css property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference). You compose these properties together, except instead of in the stylesheet, you do it directly in the browser using css classes.

```html
<button class="bwa0 bg-hotpink white h4 pl3 pr3 db w-100">
  Sign up
</button>
```

Eventually you can build [entire UIs](https://github.com/preons/preons#-examples) with very little or no additional css.
