> **Guide incomplete**

This guide is to demonstrate how quickly you can build a website with Preons using ready-made components. It should take 15 minutes, not because of any technical reasons, but if you're like me, you'll be lamenting over which modules to choose.

We're going to build a landing page for our fruit and vegetable store.

## The Base HTML

You can start in one of two ways.

1. Play with the live code [repl](https://repl.it/@gemmadlou/Starter#index.html)

2. Copy-paste the code below into your editor and run locally.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Preons docs</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Raleway:wght@200;400;500;600;700&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
    <link href="https://unpkg.com/preons/dist/reset.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="https://unpkg.com/preons/dist/preons.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body class=""></body>
</html>
```

## The Navigation

👉 Grab the HTML from the [navigation example](https://ui.preons.co/?path=/story/navigation--responsive). It is already responsive, but you can tweak it to suit your needs.

## The Hero section

👉 Grab the HTML from the [hero example](https://ui.preons.co/?path=/story/hero--hero-1).

## The Portfolio

👉 For the portfolio, you can use a [simple grid](https://ui.preons.co/?path=/story/grid--grid-of-4). The images are from unsplash but of course, you can change them or use your own personal ones.

## The Get In Touch Form

> incomplete

## The Footer

👉 There are two parts. The [footer links](https://ui.preons.co/?path=/story/footer--footer-inverted) and the [legal end](https://ui.preons.co/?path=/story/legals--legals-1). Grab both.

## What does your version look like

Here's mine. I added a testimonial and changed the grid size.

And here's the code:

## The Reference

Functional CSS will seem cryptic, at least at first. Use the [reference](/search) to know what to create.
