> **Guide incomplete**

This guide is to demonstrate how quickly you can build a website with Preons using ready-made components. It should take 15 minutes, not because of any technical reasons, but if you're like me, you'll be lamenting over which modules to choose.

We're going to build a landing page for our fruit and vegetable store.

## The Base HTML

You can start in one of two ways.

1. Play with the live code [repl](https://repl.it/@gemmadlou/Starter#index.html)

2. Copy-paste the code below into your editor and run locally.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Preons docs</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Raleway:wght@200;400;500;600;700&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
    <link href="https://unpkg.com/preons/dist/reset.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="https://unpkg.com/preons/dist/preons.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body class=""></body>
</html>
```

## The Navigation

Now you've gotten setup. The first thing we'll add is the navigation. I'll let you choose what's most appropriate.

## The Reference

Functional CSS will seem cryptic, at least at first. Use the [reference](/search) to know what to create.
