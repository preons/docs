Preons' mission is this:

1. Make it easier to build and componentize user interfaces
2. Allow anyone to create beautiful, custom web sites

## Not really a Roadmap

Whilst not entirely a fan of the todo list, it's good to share to what's on the horizon for Preons.

## Stage One

- [ ] Preons documentation
- [x] Cheatsheet lookup (reference)
- [x] Configuaration syntax
- [ ] CLI
  - [x] Sass generator
  - [x] Css generator
  - [x] References generator
  - [x] Documentation generator
  - [ ] Components generator
  - [ ] Reverse generator. Create preons.yaml from functional css styles
- [ ] Tests
  - [ ] CLI
  - [ ] UI
